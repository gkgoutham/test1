Hereâ€™s an example of Gherkin-style Given-When-Then acceptance criteria for migrating a service from Java 1.8 to 17 in Jira:

Acceptance Criteria

Scenario 1: Ensure the application compiles and runs with Java 17
Given the service is currently running on Java 1.8
When the service is upgraded to Java 17
Then the application should compile successfully without errors

Scenario 2: Ensure all dependencies are compatible with Java 17
Given the service has dependencies compatible with Java 1.8
When the dependencies are updated for Java 17 compatibility
Then the service should function correctly without breaking changes

Scenario 3: Ensure the service passes all unit and integration tests
Given the service has a suite of unit and integration tests
When the tests are executed on Java 17
Then all tests should pass successfully

Scenario 4: Ensure the service runs successfully in the target environment
Given the service is deployed on an environment using Java 1.8
When the service is deployed in the same environment but running Java 17
Then the application should start and function as expected

Scenario 5: Ensure performance and memory footprint are within acceptable limits
Given the service has performance benchmarks on Java 1.8
When the service is migrated to Java 17
Then the performance and memory consumption should be within acceptable limits

Scenario 6: Ensure backward compatibility of APIs
Given the service exposes APIs to consumers
When the service is migrated to Java 17
Then API contracts should remain unchanged unless explicitly planned for updates
