Project: Intelligent API Automation & Test Generation Platform

Objective

I want to build a Python-based platform that automatically understands an application’s REST APIs from its OpenAPI/Swagger specification and generates intelligent API testing artifacts without depending on an LLM during runtime.

The platform should be modular, extensible, deterministic, and capable of working for any REST API project. AI should be treated as an optional enhancement rather than a mandatory dependency.

The long-term vision is to create an “API Intelligence Platform” rather than a simple Swagger-to-Postman converter.

⸻

Overall Architecture

The platform should follow a compiler-like architecture.

Generator  Runner       Generator      Generator

Every module must be independent.

⸻

Primary Goals

The platform should automatically:

* Parse OpenAPI 3.x and Swagger specifications.
* Discover APIs.
* Discover entities.
* Identify CRUD operations.
* Detect dependencies.
* Correlate request and response parameters.
* Generate executable API workflows.
* Generate Postman collections.
* Generate Newman execution suites.
* Generate JMeter performance scripts.
* Support optional business knowledge.
* Generate reports.
* Integrate into Jenkins CI/CD.

⸻

Design Principles

The platform must be:

* Modular
* Extensible
* Rule-driven
* Explainable
* Deterministic
* Configurable
* Plugin-based
* AI Optional

No module should directly depend on another module’s implementation.

Everything should communicate using models.

⸻

Phase 1 — OpenAPI Parser

Create a parser capable of extracting:

* API Paths
* HTTP Methods
* Request Parameters
* Query Parameters
* Path Variables
* Headers
* Request Body
* Response Body
* Status Codes
* Examples
* Components/Schemas
* Security Definitions

Represent each API as a Python object.

Example:

ApiDefinition
name
method
path
request
response
tags
schemas
security
description

⸻

Phase 2 — Entity Discovery Engine

Automatically identify business entities.

Examples:

Device

Alert

Policy

User

Customer

Tenant

Gateway

Rule

Job

Task

The engine should use:

* URL path
* Tags
* Schema names
* Request models
* Response models

No AI.

Only deterministic rules.

⸻

Phase 3 — CRUD Classification

Automatically classify APIs into:

Create

Read

Update

Delete

List

Search

Execute

Enroll

Provision

Activate

Deactivate

Import

Export

Instead of only relying on keywords, use:

* HTTP Method
* Path
* Schema
* Tags

Allow custom mappings.

Example:

register -> Create
provision -> Create
activate -> Update
disable -> Update
search -> Search

⸻

Phase 4 — Request/Response Correlation Engine

This is the heart of the platform.

Identify which response fields should become variables for subsequent APIs.

Example

POST /devices
Response
deviceId

Later

PUT /devices/{deviceId}

Automatically map

response.deviceId
↓
request.deviceId

The engine should compare:

* Field name similarity
* Data type
* JSON path
* Required fields
* Entity ownership
* Schema reference

Generate confidence scores.

Example

deviceId
↓
id
Score
0.94

Only accept mappings above a configurable threshold.

⸻

Phase 5 — Dependency Graph

Represent APIs as a directed graph.

Node

API

Edge

Dependency

Example

Create Device
↓
Enroll
↓
Execute Command
↓
Get Status
↓
Delete

Store graph using NetworkX.

Support:

* Topological Sort
* Path Finding
* Cycle Detection
* Entity Dependency
* Flow Discovery

⸻

Phase 6 — Canonical Flow Model

Do NOT generate Postman directly.

Generate an intermediate representation.

Example

flow:
- api: CreateDevice
  save:
      deviceId: $.id
- api: Enroll
  input:
      deviceId: ${deviceId}
  save:
      enrollmentId: $.id
- api: ExecuteCommand
  input:
      enrollmentId: ${enrollmentId}
  save:
      commandId: $.id
- api: Status
  input:
      commandId: ${commandId}

This becomes the platform’s source of truth.

Every output generator consumes this model.

⸻

Phase 7 — Business Flow Generator

Automatically generate flows such as:

CRUD Flow

Smoke Flow

Regression Flow

Entity Lifecycle

Module Flow

Cross Module Flow

Examples

Alert

Create

↓

List

↓

Update

↓

Delete

Device

Create

↓

Enroll

↓

Assign Policy

↓

Execute Command

↓

Verify

↓

Delete

⸻

Phase 8 — Knowledge Base Plugin (Optional)

Knowledge Base must NOT be mandatory.

If absent

Platform still works.

If present

Platform becomes smarter.

Knowledge Base should store business semantics rather than endpoint details.

Example

entity: Device
businessCapabilities:
- Create
- Enroll
- Assign Policy
- Execute Command
- Upgrade
- Reboot
- Delete
criticality: High
performance:
    users: 300
    rampUp: 120
    thinkTime: 3

Swagger determines endpoints.

KB determines business intent.

⸻

Phase 9 — Plugin Architecture

Support plugins.

Example

plugins/
yaml_kb/
custom_rules/
jira/
confluence/
vector_db/
custom_agent/
execution_history/

Each plugin should implement interfaces.

No hard-coded dependencies.

⸻

Phase 10 — Postman Generator

Generate production-ready Postman collections.

Features:

Variables

Folder Organization

Authentication

Pre-request Scripts

Tests

Environment Variables

Collection Variables

Automatic Variable Extraction

Assertions

Collection Runner Compatibility

Newman Compatibility

⸻

Phase 11 — Newman Generator

Automatically generate:

Smoke Suite

Regression Suite

Sanity Suite

Entity Suite

Module Suite

Nightly Suite

Support command generation.

⸻

Phase 12 — JMeter Generator

Generate JMX files.

Automatically create:

Thread Groups

CSV Data Sets

HTTP Samplers

Extractors

Assertions

Think Time

Timers

Variables

Correlation

Reports

Support configuration such as:

performance:
users: 200
rampUp: 60
duration: 1800
loop: infinite

The user should not manually edit JMeter.

⸻

Phase 13 — Jenkins Integration

Pipeline

Swagger Changed
↓
Platform
↓
Generate Flows
↓
Generate Postman
↓
Generate JMeter
↓
Run Newman
↓
Run Performance
↓
Publish Reports
↓
Archive Results
↓

Support Git-based execution.

⸻

Phase 14 — Configuration System

Everything should be configurable.

Example

project:
name:
environment:
baseUrl:
authentication:
flowGeneration:
performance:
correlation:
plugins:
reports:

No hard-coded values.

⸻

Phase 15 — Reports

Generate:

HTML

Markdown

JSON

Coverage Report

Dependency Graph

Execution Summary

Missing Correlations

Unused APIs

Critical APIs

Performance Summary

⸻

Phase 16 — Future AI Support

LLMs should only assist.

Never generate everything.

Possible uses:

* Validate low-confidence mappings.
* Suggest business flows.
* Improve documentation.
* Explain APIs.
* Generate missing Knowledge Base.
* Recommend regression suites.

The deterministic engine remains the primary implementation.

⸻

Phase 17 — Machine Learning (Future)

Traditional ML should be optional.

Potential models:

* CRUD Classification
* API Categorization
* Parameter Similarity
* Flow Recommendation
* Business Capability Prediction

Train only if sufficient historical data exists.

Do not make ML mandatory.

* Extensible APIs
* Well Documented
* CI/CD Friendly
* Production Ready

⸻

Ultimate Vision

The end goal is not to build another Swagger parser.

The goal is to build a platform that understands an application’s APIs, discovers entities and relationships, infers executable business workflows, and produces multiple testing and automation artifacts from a single semantic model.

The semantic model should become the single source of truth from which the platform can generate:

* Postman Collections
* Newman Suites
* JMeter Performance Tests
* Smoke Tests
* Regression Suites
* Business Flow Tests
* API Documentation
* Dependency Graphs
* Coverage Reports
* CI/CD Pipelines
* Future AI-assisted recommendations

The architecture must be generic enough to work across different domains while allowing optional domain-specific intelligence through pluggable Knowledge Base modules.


I actually think Version 2 (with AI) should already be in your mind, but not in your code. Design the architecture so that AI becomes just another plugin later.

Something like this:

Current (v1)
OpenAPI
   │
Parser
   │
Semantic Model
   │
Graph Engine
   │
Rule Engine
   │
Flow Engine
   │
Generators
Future (v2)
OpenAPI
   │
Parser
   │
Semantic Model
   │
Graph Engine
   │
Rule Engine
   │
AI Plugin
   │
Flow Engine
   │
Generators

Notice that nothing above the AI plugin changes. That’s a sign of good architecture.

What was missing in the prompt?

You’re right—my previous prompt focused on architecture, not on the computer science behind it.

If I were writing this as a software engineering project or even an M.Tech thesis, I’d explicitly mention the algorithmic foundations.

Graph Theory

* Directed Graphs
* DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
* DFS
* BFS
* Topological Sorting
* Strongly Connected Components
* Reachability
* Shortest Path

⸻

String Matching

* Levenshtein Distance
* Jaro-Winkler
* Jaccard Similarity
* Cosine Similarity
* TF-IDF (future)

⸻

JSON Processing

* Recursive Descent Parsing
* Tree Traversal
* JSON Pointer Resolution
* JSONPath

⸻

Schema Matching

A whole research field.

Look into papers on:

* Schema Matching
* Ontology Matching
* Record Linkage
* Entity Resolution

These are very relevant to your parameter-correlation problem.

⸻

Rule Engine

Use

* Weighted Rules
* Decision Tables
* Confidence Scores
* Priority Resolution

⸻

Knowledge Representation

Instead of treating the KB as just YAML, think of it as a lightweight knowledge graph.

Device
↓
Enroll
↓
Command
↓
Policy
↓
Firmware

This makes future AI integration much more natural.

⸻

Search Algorithms

* BFS
* DFS
* Beam Search (future)
* A* (if you introduce weighted costs)

⸻

Optimization

* Memoization (avoid repeating expensive correlation work)
* Caching
* Incremental graph updates when the OpenAPI spec changes
* Parallel processing with concurrent.futures for large API sets

⸻

Machine Learning (Version 2)

Only after Version 1 is stable.

Possible models:

* Logistic Regression → CRUD classification
* Random Forest → Flow classification
* XGBoost → Confidence prediction
* Word2Vec/FastText → Field similarity
* Sentence Transformers/Embeddings → Semantic matching
* Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) → Advanced dependency inference (very advanced, likely only worthwhile after you’ve accumulated lots of execution data)

⸻

One suggestion that could make this a truly unique project

I would add a Confidence Engine as a first-class component. Every inference—entity discovery, CRUD classification, parameter correlation, flow generation—should produce not just a result but also a confidence score and an explanation.

For example:

Correlation:
response.device.id
      ↓
request.deviceId
Confidence: 0.94
Reason:
✓ Same entity (Device)
✓ Same datatype (UUID)
✓ High name similarity
✓ Produced by parent API
✓ Referenced by three downstream APIs

That gives users trust in the generated artifacts, lets you automatically accept high-confidence mappings, flags low-confidence ones for review, and provides an ideal integration point for an AI plugin in Version 2, where the AI only needs to resolve ambiguous cases rather than regenerate everything. I think that single design decision will make the platform far more maintainable and production-ready

mkdir -p docs config examples tests plugins

mkdir -p flowforge/{core,parser,models,graph,correlation,flow,utils}

mkdir -p flowforge/generators/{postman,jmeter,reports}
.

Correct. 👍

I was describing the **design**, not the Python implementation.

Now let's actually write the code.

Since you're using Python 3.10+ (I assume), I'd use **dataclasses**.

## parameter.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Any, Optional


@dataclass
class Parameter:
    """
    Represents an API parameter.

    Example:
        Path Parameter:
            /devices/{deviceId}

        Query Parameter:
            ?page=1

        Header:
            Authorization

        Request Body Field:
            deviceName
    """

    name: str
    data_type: str
    location: str  # path, query, header, body
    required: bool = False
    description: Optional[str] = None
    example: Any = None
```

This is a complete model.

---

## schema.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List

from .parameter import Parameter


@dataclass
class Schema:
    name: str
    fields: List[Parameter] = field(default_factory=list)
```

Notice:

A Schema contains many Parameters.

---

## response.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Optional

from .schema import Schema


@dataclass
class Response:
    status_code: int
    description: str
    schema: Optional[Schema] = None
```

---

## api_definition.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Optional

from .parameter import Parameter
from .response import Response
from .schema import Schema


@dataclass
class ApiDefinition:
    name: str
    path: str
    method: str

    summary: Optional[str] = None
    description: Optional[str] = None

    tags: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)

    parameters: List[Parameter] = field(default_factory=list)

    request_body: Optional[Schema] = None

    responses: List[Response] = field(default_factory=list)
```

---

## Why this design?

Suppose your Swagger contains:

```yaml
POST /devices

Request Body:
    name
    serialNumber

Response:
    deviceId
    name
```

The parser will create:

```text
ApiDefinition
│
├── Parameters
│
├── RequestBody (Schema)
│
│      ├── Parameter(name)
│      └── Parameter(serialNumber)
│
└── Responses
        │
        └── Response(201)
                │
                └── Schema
                        │
                        ├── Parameter(deviceId)
                        └── Parameter(name)
```

Notice how everything is connected.

---

# My advice

Don't try to create all 9 models today.

Instead, build them in this order:

1. ✅ Parameter
2. ✅ Schema
3. ✅ Response
4. ✅ ApiDefinition
5. Project
6. Entity
7. Variable
8. Dependency
9. Flow

After `ApiDefinition` is complete, we'll write the **Swagger Parser**. Once the parser is working, the remaining models (Entity, Flow, Dependency, etc.) will become much easier to design because you'll have real API data flowing through the system instead of guessing what fields you'll need.

This iterative approach will save you from redesigning models later.
