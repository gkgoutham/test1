Got it! Here’s how you can document the step-by-step migration approach, including the sequence of changes, issues, fixes, and milestones until the application is successfully migrated. This can complement the issue documentation or serve as a standalone migration log.

Migration Steps Documentation

Project Details
	•	Project Name:
	•	Migration Scope: (E.g., Migrating application from JDK 1.8 to JDK 17)
	•	Tools Used: (E.g., OpenRewrite, jdeps, etc.)
	•	Start Date:
	•	Completion Date:

Migration Steps Log

Step 1: Initial Setup
	•	Action: Updated build tools to support JDK 17.
	•	Maven/Gradle version updated: (e.g., Gradle 7.6 or Maven 3.8.5)
	•	Configured project to use JDK 17 locally.
	•	Updated pom.xml/build.gradle with the required JDK version.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Build failed due to dependency compatibility issues.

Step 2: Dependency Analysis
	•	Action:
	•	Used jdeps to analyze dependencies incompatible with JDK 17.
	•	Ran OpenRewrite to refactor code automatically (e.g., replace deprecated APIs).
	•	Outcome:
	•	Identified the following:
	•	XYZ library requires an upgrade.
	•	Usage of sun.misc.Unsafe in internal code.

Step 3: Upgrading Dependencies
	•	Action:
	•	Upgraded libraries with compatible versions.
	•	Example: Updated XYZ library from v1.2.3 to v2.0.1.
	•	Updated third-party APIs with new version-specific features.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Some libraries caused runtime failures (e.g., IllegalAccessException).

Step 4: Fixing Runtime Issues

Issue: Illegal Reflective Access
	•	Action:
	•	Temporarily added JVM flags: --add-opens for reflective access.
	•	Updated reflection-based code to use standard Java APIs where possible.
	•	Outcome:
	•	The application started but failed integration tests.

Step 5: Replacing Deprecated APIs
	•	Action:
	•	Replaced sun.misc.Unsafe with java.util.concurrent APIs.
	•	Refactored code using OpenRewrite scripts for other deprecated APIs.
	•	Manually updated areas OpenRewrite could not cover.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Application built successfully, but some tests needed updates.

Step 6: Code Validation and Test Updates
	•	Action:
	•	Fixed failing unit and integration tests caused by API changes.
	•	Added new test cases for behavior changes introduced in JDK 17.
	•	Outcome:
	•	All tests passed in the local environment.

Step 7: Performance and Staging Validation
	•	Action:
	•	Deployed application to a staging environment for load testing.
	•	Validated performance benchmarks (e.g., GC behavior, memory usage).
	•	Monitored logs for unexpected warnings/errors.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Resolved minor performance bottlenecks due to stricter JDK 17 validation.

Step 8: Final Deployment
	•	Action:
	•	Deployed to production with feature flags for gradual rollout.
	•	Closely monitored performance and user feedback.
	•	Outcome:
	•	Migration successful with no reported issues in production.

Summary
	1.	Total Time Taken: e.g., 3 weeks
	2.	Key Challenges Faced:
	•	Incompatible dependencies.
	•	Reflection-related runtime issues.
	•	Deprecated API replacements.
	3.	Tools That Helped:
	•	OpenRewrite for code refactoring.
	•	JDeps for dependency analysis.
	4.	Lessons Learned:
	•	Automate repetitive changes using tools like OpenRewrite.
	•	Start with a staging environment for iterative testing.
	•	Maintain modular libraries to isolate JDK-specific upgrades.

This approach breaks the migration into sequential, traceable steps. It helps other developers follow the process and ensures no step is overlooked in future migrations. Let me know if you’d like further refinement!
